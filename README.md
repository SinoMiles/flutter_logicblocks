# Flutter Logic Blocks
Flutter logic blocks is a library for creating visual programming editors. The core of the project is collection of helper widgets for handling input and rendering, which is then combined with one of the block styles below.

Inspired by the [ScratchBlocks](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-blocks) project, with some minor changes made.

Themed text fields and buttons are coming soon.

### Modern (Horizontal)
Planned, however no set target.

### Material
Planned, however no set target.

### Retro
Coming soon.

## State
Flutter logic blocks makes no assumptions about what state framework you are using. The examples show off using [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc). However any standard state framework should work. If not, please open an issue and I can look at making the needed changes.
